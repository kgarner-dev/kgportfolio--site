            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>After high school, I left for college playing baseball and pursuing a degree in Biology, with the goal of eventually getting into medical school. After some unexpected changes, I found myself back home wondering what was next. I spent a little time working in the medical field, but found myself embarking on a self-taught journey into becoming a developer at the beginning of 2022.</p>
            <p>After six months of dedicated studying and coding, I landed a web development role, where I continue to work today. I'm always pushing myself to grow as a developer, and one way I am completing that task is within my pursuit of my Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity.</p>
